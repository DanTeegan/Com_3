#Business Homework
#MOST

This stand for Mission, Objectives, Strategy, Tactics

1.	Mission – What the organisation is about, what it is seeking to achieve.

2.	Objectives – Goals against which the organisations achievements can be measured.

3.	Strategy – the approach the organisation will adopt to achieving its mission and objectives.

4.	Tactics – The detailed way in which the strategy will be implemented. The tactics component of “MOST” is where the projects are identified and initiated. It is where the agile BA begins the task of ensuring that overall alignment with the strategy and objectives is maintained from pre-project though to deployment and benefits assessment.

#Porters Five Forces

Porter's Five Forces is a simple but powerful tool for understanding the competitiveness of your business environment, and for identifying your strategy's potential profitability.

1.	Competitive Rivalry. This looks at the number and strength of your competitors. How many rivals do you have?

2.	Supplier Power. This is determined by how easy it is for your suppliers to increase their prices. How many potential suppliers do you have? How unique is the product or service that they provide, and how expensive would it be to switch from one supplier to another?

3.	Buyer Power. Here, you ask yourself how easy it is for buyers to drive your prices down. How many buyers are there, and how big are their orders? How much would it cost them to switch from your products and services to those of a rival? Are your buyers strong enough to dictate terms to you?

4.	Threat of Substitution. This refers to the likelihood of your customers finding a different way of doing what you do. For example, if you supply a unique software product that automates an important process, people may substitute it by doing the process manually or by outsourcing it.

5.	Threat of New Entry. Your position can be affected by people's ability to enter your market. So, think about how easily this could be done. How easy is it to get a foothold in your industry or market? How much would it cost, and how tightly is your sector regulated?
