Handling situations

Take time to understand the situation. Listen to their view before reacting. Don’t respond with a definitive standpoint too quickly
Know your audience. Are they a know it all? Or are they close minded? Knowing this should change the way that you deal with them
Ask other for their perspective. Gain viewpoints from outside of the bubble.

Neuro-linguistic programming
NLP is the practice of understanding how people organise their thinking, feeling, language and behaviour to produce the results they do.
NLP is also used for personal development and for success in business
A key element of NLP is that we form our unique internal mental maps of the world as a product of the way we filter and perceive information absorbed through our five senses from the world around us
Shape your reality using these techniques.
“learning the language of your own mind”
How is NLP Beneficial
•	Think more clearly
•	Communicate more effectively with others
•	Manage your thoughts, moods and behaviour effectively
•	Medical benefits
NLP in the workplace
•	Problems are usually internal – work experiences are related to the individual rather than the workplace
•	Studying language patterns to tailor communication methods – Building workplace relationships, influencing the way other people think.
•	Managing emotions – control your reaction towards negative events, stress, anger.

Cognitive biases
The mind is an operating system. It has multiple processes always running in the background. It can’t always work perfectly.
There are hidden flaws, backdoors and hacks that people can use to access our minds and subsequently our ways of working.
Exploiting bias in the workplace
•	Reactance – by telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes.
•	Reciprocity – be the first to give: the feeling of obligation to give when you receive. Personalised and unexpected
•	Door in the face – forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request.
•	Likability – give compliments and build cooperation 
•	The bystander effect – people look to others to determine their own actions


Actions within the workplace
•	Don’t stereotype
•	Be open to ideas outside of your existing beliefs 
•	Stay level headed and treat people with respect
•	It isn’t personal, the way people act in pressured environments isn’t often a true representation of themselves.
•	Create an environment that thrives on reciprocity.
